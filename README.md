# SQL-Multiple-Table-Project-on--Movies-Dataset

Here are five problem statements you can explore using The Movies Dataset from Kaggle:

1. Find the Top-Rated Movies by Genre
Problem: Identify the top 5 highest-rated movies in each genre (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).
Details: By joining the movies_metadata.csv (which contains movie titles and genres) with ratings.csv (which contains user ratings), you can group the movies by genre and calculate average ratings to rank them.
SQL Concept: INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, AVG()
2. Analyze Movie Revenue by Release Year
Problem: Analyze which years had the highest total movie revenue and which individual movies contributed the most.
Details: Using the movies_metadata.csv table, extract the release_date and revenue columns. You can aggregate the total revenue by year and identify the top-performing movies for each year.
SQL Concept: GROUP BY, SUM(), ORDER BY
3. Find the Most Prolific Directors
Problem: Determine which directors have made the most movies in the dataset.
Details: Join the movies_metadata.csv (which contains directors in the crew column) with other relevant data to count how many films each director has worked on.
SQL Concept: GROUP BY, COUNT(), ORDER BY
4. Analyze Popular Movie Trends Based on Runtime
Problem: Explore how the runtime of movies has changed over the years and which runtimes are most common in specific genres.
Details: By combining data from movies_metadata.csv (for runtime and genre) with ratings.csv, you can determine trends in runtime for various genres and time periods.
SQL Concept: INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, AVG(), ORDER BY
5. Correlation Between Budget and Revenue
Problem: Investigate the relationship between a movieâ€™s budget and its revenue, and identify if higher-budget movies tend to generate more revenue.
Details: Using movies_metadata.csv, analyze the correlation between the budget and revenue columns. You can also break this down by genre or year to find trends.
SQL Concept: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, AVG()
These problem statements will allow you to practice various SQL joins and data manipulation techniques, while exploring movie trends and insights using this diverse dataset.
